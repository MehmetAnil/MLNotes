## Inner join

Only return rows that have matching value in both tables. 

`df1.merge(df2, on='col1')`: Joining two dataframes on col1 values. df1 columns would appear first in output.

`df1.merge(df2, on='col1', suffixes=('_a', '_b')`: If column names are same in both dataframes by default columns in
dataframe are renamed like col_x, col_y. If we want to edit the names ourselves, we can set it with the suffix parameter. 
(Column names will be col_a, col_b)
